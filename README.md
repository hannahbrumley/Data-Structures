# Data Structures

This project implements essential data structures with clear functionality and thorough testing.

## Implemented Structures

### Binary Search Tree
- Stores data in a sorted, hierarchical structure.
- Supports insertion, search, and traversal.

### Hash Table
- Key-value storage with collision handling.
- Uses linear and quadratic probing.

### Linked List
- Sequential data storage with dynamic node allocation.
- Allows insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Queue
- FIFO structure with array and linked-list implementations.
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue, size.

### Smart Dynamic Array
- Resizable array with efficient memory management.
- Supports dynamic resizing and element access.

### Smart Table
- Key-value table with dynamic resizing.
- Efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

### Stack
- LIFO structure with array and linked-list implementations.
- Operations: push, pop, peek.

## Features
- **Testing**: Automated tests for all structures.
- **Utilities**: Logging, menus, and exception handling.
- **Design**: Modular, interface-driven, and robust.
